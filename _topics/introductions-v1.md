Throughout this course, we will be using [GitHub](http://github.com/) to manage our projects.  [GitHub](http://github.com/) allows us to have a centralized location to store and manage the projects that we will create in this class.  It also allow you to manage your own individual copy of that project, modifying it as needed, and building a history of those modifications. When you are done with your work, you'll submit your project and get feedback using a *pull request*.  Understanding how to work with Git (the underlying version control system behind [GitHub](http://github.com/)) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) are very important first steps in this course.

#### Student Directory Assignment
To get started, you will introduce yourself to the class by adding an entry to the course's [Student Directory](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/students). Most assignments will have instructions posted in the repository README file, which will be shown at the bottom of the main repository page.
