title: "Building the HTML Course and Site"
---


Welcome!  This site contains the course materials for my HTC HTML Course. As I develop this course, I'll keep track of the high points of the development here in this blog.

Putting this together will be an interesting journey both through my course material and some new technologies for me - [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/), the [Shiori theme](http://ellekasai.github.io/shiori/).  At some point (hopefully before fall semester) I'd also like to incorporate quizzes, possibly using the [llab](https://github.com/beautyjoy/llab) module from Berkeley  (or a modified version of it - as I only care about the quizzes) which was used in their [BJC](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/) material. 

## Jekyll
I discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) by accident as I was looking at how the [BJC](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/) material from Berkeley is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).  Their material is mainly put together using JavaScript to dynamically create the pages from JSON files.  Neat, but half the time I'm seeing half rendered pages before things look right.  Not the best user experience.  Since the material itself is not really interactive except for a few quizzes, I wondered if Jekyll would provide the ability to build a course dynamically from various data files into static HTML that would render a bit nicer.

So far I've been pleased with what I've managed to put together, but I've learned that you need to be careful with using plugins for Jekyll if you want to use [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).  If you plan to upload just your files and let their server build your site, there are only a few plugins that you can use.  There's a work around for this by building locally and then uploading those HTML files to the gh-pages branch of your repository, but that seemed like extra work I didn't want to deal with right now.  

## Shiori
There are many themes available to use for your Jekyll blog site, and I wasted away quite a bit of time looking at them.  Since my site is more than just a blog though, I wanted something fairly clean and simple.  I didn't want it to be distracting or get in the way of the content, and I despite this being an HTML/CSS class I had better things to do than write CSS myself. (Two weeks until classes start! :sweat_smile:)  The Shiori style was perfect, but I've had to adjust the site structure quite a bit so that it better fits my design and purpose.  I'll talk more about that in the upcoming posts.
