<p>
This course is an introduction to HTML5 and CSS. In this course, you'll be learning to make web pages that look good on different web browsers, different operating systems, and on multiple display sizes. By the end of the course, you'll have a good foundation for continuing studies in web development and have your own web site to host your future projects and portfolio.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
There are a few things you need right away in order to be successful in this course:
    <ol>
        <li>The textbook - Basics of Web Design: HTML5 &amp; CSS3 by Terry Felke-Morris (ISBN-10: 0133128911 ).  The assigned reading from the textbook explains most key concepts.  This site will not repeat that information, only provide supplementary material.</li>
        <li>An editor with syntax highlighting, such as <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>. While other editors will work, I would encourage you to use Brackets for this course.  It runs a web server under the covers which will support some of the later topics such as custom fonts without requiring you to download and install a separate web server.</li>
        <li>A <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account.  We will be working with git and GitHub to develop our projects throughout this course.  Set yourself up with an account - I encourage you to use your actual name, then follow me (htcMosman), and email me with both your real name and account name.  I will then add you to the course Organization so that you can access our team repositories.</li>
    </ol>
