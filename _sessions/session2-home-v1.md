As you read through these chapters, pay particular attention to accessibility.  It is expected that you will always provide *meaningful* alt text for images.  Because you cannot (easily) provide alt text for images configured in CSS, it is recommended that you do not use CSS for images that are not decorative.  If the image conveys meaning to the viewer, it should be configured using the HTML `<img>` tag with alt text, so that meaning is not lost on those who cannot see the image itself.
